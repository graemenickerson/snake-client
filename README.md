# Snake Client
### September 2019

### Objectives
Before we dig in here, let's step back and talk about what we're looking to get out of it.

In building out this small project, we aim to:

- get a better understanding on how networking works (from the client-side perspective)
- review and use important concepts covered previously, such as
  - callbacks
  - asynchronous control flow
  - modules in node and writing modular code
  - refactoring code
  - working with stdin

Due to the nature and timing of this project, we will NOT be focusing on:

- automated testing (i.e. unit testing with Mocha & Chai)
- interesting ways to manage and manipulate data using arrays and/or objects

By the end of this mini half-day project, we will have a better understanding of how TCP networking works. We will also get more comfortable with asynchronous programming and creating TCP clients using Node's built-in net module. Oh, and we'll hopefully have some fun along the way!

### Credit
Our server code for this game was not written from scratch! It is a heavily modified version of the single player game Snek created by Tania Rascia.

The demonstration GIF above is taken from the single-player version. It gives us a general idea of the gameplay and style, but ours is a heavily modified multi-player version of the game.
